## Introduction

Multivariate Time Series forecasting is a critical task in various domains, and this repository focuses on implementing the MMM approach using non-linear models. The MMM approach involves modeling the dependencies between multiple time series variables to improve forecasting accuracy.

In addition to implementing non-linear models, this repository also demonstrates the use of SHAP values for interpreting model predictions. SHAP values provide insights into the contribution of each feature to the model's output, enhancing the interpretability of complex models.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/MMM-using-Non-linear-models-and-SHAP-Values.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the examples in the `examples` directory to see how to use the MMM approach with non-linear models and interpret the results using SHAP values.

```python
# Example code snippet
from mmm_model import NonLinearMMM
from shap_interpretation import SHAPInterpreter

# Load your time series data
# ...

# Initialize and fit the non-linear MMM model
model = NonLinearMMM()
model.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_data)

# Interpret the model predictions using SHAP values
shap_interpreter = SHAPInterpreter(model)
shap_values = shap_interpreter.interpret(test_data)

# Visualize SHAP values
shap_interpreter.plot_shap_values(shap_values)
```

## Models

This repository supports various non-linear models for MMM forecasting. Some of the implemented models include:

- Random Forest
- XgBoost

Feel free to explore the `models` directory for more details on each model implementation.

## SHAP Values

The `shap_interpretation` module contains code for interpreting model predictions using SHAP values. This enables a better understanding of the impact of each feature on the model's output.
